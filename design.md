*   **Concept:** A cosmic horror survival game inspired by *Voices of the Void*. You are a lone operator in a remote observatory, processing deep space signals while navigating the physical station in a first-person, ASCII-rendered environment. The horror comes from the signal content, system glitches, and a growing sense of a malevolent presence.

*   **Gameplay - Terminal Mode:**
    *   The core loop: Use command-line tools to `scan` for signals, `filter` noise, `analyze` patterns, and `decode` their content.
    *   Submit findings with `submit` to earn credits for system upgrades and life support.
    *   The content of decoded signals is the primary source of narrative and horror.

*   **Gameplay - Exploration Mode:**
    *   The station is rendered in a first-person, grid-based view using ASCII characters (`#` for walls, `D` for doors, etc.).
    *   Movement is with WASD/arrow keys; `W/S` to move, `A/D` to turn 90 degrees, instantly re-rendering the scene.
    *   This mode is for physically moving to different station modules (e.g., generator room, server bay, living quarters) to perform repairs, investigate anomalies, or simply survive.
    *   The limited, claustrophobic view is a key horror element. The game can use this for jump scares, environmental storytelling, and reality-bending visual glitches as your sanity degrades.

*   **Potential Mechanics:**
    *   **Dynamic Sanity System:** Your sanity level has direct gameplay effects. This can include visual hallucinations (ASCII render glitches, seeing figures that aren't there), auditory hallucinations (false sound descriptions in the log), phantom system alerts designed to cause panic, and even the terminal refusing or talking back to your commands.
    *   **Signal "Haunting":** The signals you process directly infect your reality. Decoding a star chart might change the constellations outside your window. Decoding a blueprint might cause the object to begin assembling itself in the workshop. A voice in a signal might have its name appear in random system logs, as if it's haunting the machine.
    *   **Base Degradation & Survival:** The station is old and actively decaying. You must manage critical life support resources and perform maintenance. This includes:
        *   **Power:** Keep the main generator running and manage backup batteries. Power outages can be catastrophic.
        *   **Oxygen:** Maintain CO2 scrubbers and reserve oxygen tanks. A hull breach or system failure can lead to suffocation.
        *   **Supplies:** Manage finite weekly supplies of `Water Filters`, `Food Cartridges`, and `Repair Parts`.
        *   **Wear & Tear:** Systems degrade with use and can fail randomly, requiring physical repairs and spare parts.
    *   **Endgame Scenarios:** The game has multiple endings based on your choices.
        *   **The Convergence (Bad Ending):** You obey the entity, resulting in your consciousness being absorbed.
        *   **The Severance (Good Ending):** You devise a counter-signal to silence the entity, saving yourself and Earth.
        *   **The Escape (Neutral Ending):** You abandon the station and the mystery, escaping with your life but leaving the threat for someone else.
